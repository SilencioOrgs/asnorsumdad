// About Section
export const aboutContent = `I'm a full-stack developer with a strong background in software engineering, IoT, and AI-powered applications. I specialize in building modern web platforms, mobile apps, and hardware-integrated systems that solve real-world problems.

I have worked as the primary developer for multiple client projects, capstone systems, and thesis-level applications, delivering production-ready solutions using technologies like Next.js, Flutter, FastAPI, Firebase, Supabase, and ESP32-based hardware.

My focus is on creating clean, scalable, and reliable systems — whether it's an AI-driven web app, a real-time tracking platform, or a smart embedded device. I enjoy turning complex ideas into usable, high-impact digital products.`;
